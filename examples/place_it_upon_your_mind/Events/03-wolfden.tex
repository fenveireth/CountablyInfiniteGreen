You have found the Lair of the Clansingers deep in the heart of the Packlands.
Most of the Clan is out hunting this day, but they have posted a sentry.

Its posture and energy leave absolutely no room for doubt: it is guarding some
kind of Treasure.

Sneaking past it will be impossible, as it is directly blocking the Lair. How
will you proceed?

\option Ambush it stealthily.
	% Check on 'RAW_': ignores any buff/debuff, and the foreshadowing planet will
	% not come up.
	% The foreshadowing is only active for \if checks anyway, not \hidden checks
	\hidden{RAW_WATER >= 50}
	\hint{If only you could blend in with your surroudings...}
	\go{gw3_1a}

\option Challenge it honorably. \go{gw3_1b}

\option Leave this place, for now, and spend this Sun elsewhere.
	% Undo the set from the map button
	\set{GW3_VISITED = 0} \go{gw3_1c}


\event{gw3_1a}
You shift your armor's colors to blend in with your surroundings. Circling
around, you climb up the opposite side of the Lair-hill. Your movements are
slow, so slow you are barely moving, but your are a patient and accomplished
predator.

Clansingers have powerful ears and noses, but your expertise has brought you
victory; you are within pouncing range of the guard, perched on the hill above
it, and it does not know you are there. When the moment is right, you strike.

The sentry is shocked by your sudden attack, and its red Essence is already on
your claws and fangs before it can properly react. Dazed and wounded, it flees
into the Green.

Soon, you hear its Summoning Song ringing out, calling the Clan back to the Lair
to defend it. You must be swift.

% text style spans cannot cross paragraph boundaries: paragraphs are processed

After you step out of hiding and announce your challenge, the sentry replies:\\

I am old, but strong, forged in many battles.

Entering the Lair, you are dismayed to find no shiny things or rare objects.
Instead, you see several hatchlings of the Clansinger people. They are redolent
with fear, but one of them bravely stands and approaches you.

<color 2878ff><wolf>I am Shining-Eye, last-born\\
of the Future of the Claws-of-the-Spirit Clan.\\
Have you come to Destroy us, Great Draak?

The aroma of their delicious, tender, milk-fed flesh calls to you. All together,
they would be a very fine meal indeed, and they are defenseless, their small
fangs and claws not even capable of piercing your armor.

How will you answer the hatchling's question?

\option Yes. (Consume them.)
	\set{TEMP_FORESHADOW_ENERGY += 50} \set{ENERGY += 50} \go{gw3_2a}

\event{gw3_2a}
The hatchlings have the spirits of warriors, and they attempt to fight you as
best they can, but they do not yet have the Bodies to put up an effective
defense. One by one, you Silence and Consume them.

The flavor is exquisite. Their flesh practically melts in your mouth, and even
their fur adds to the experience, short and velvety as it is.

As their Essence becomes yours, you feel invigorated. The adults approaching, so
you make a hasty retreat, but you have eaten well this Sun.

You explain to the younglings that you came here in search of Treasure, not

<color 2878ff><wolf>We are the greatest Treasure of the Claws-of-the-Spirit
Clan.\\ We are the Immortality of our People.

<color 2878ff><wolf>From our Birther-Creator's Body, we draw sacred milk,\\
And from our Giver-Creator's mouth, we receive warm flesh.

Into the Future; there can be no greater Treasure, or so they Sing.

Silently, you withdraw from the Lair of the Clansingers and hasten into the
Green, leaving before the Clan arrives. When they do, they are relieved and
joyous to find their precious Treasure still alive and whole.

You can hear them raise a Song of Thanksgiving for their good fortune, the Song
echoing and twisting joyfully among the Trees:

<color 00b4ff><wolf>Our Future lives! Love's labor is not lost!

Seizing Shining-Eye gently but firmly in your jaws, you retract your head from
the Lair and make swift progress through the woods.

You almost swallow or choke on it a few times in your haste, and the Clan in in
close pursuit, but they give up after you pass the boundary of their territory.

When you deposit Shining-Eye in your Lair, it sings a pitiable song, trying to
call its Clan to it, but it is much too far away to be heard.

Eventually, it collapses in despair, and you think it may have gone Silent,
Destroyed by pure grief, but after a few Suns it grows accustomed to its new
home and regains its energy.

Soon, it has learned to look to you for sustenance and entertainment. You must
provide food for it, reducing your own stores, and your tail becomes a veritable
chew-toy.

You can, at least, consume it if it grows too troublesome.
