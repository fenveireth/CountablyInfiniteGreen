This Sun, you have discovered a hidden outcropping of beautiful shinestone
peeking though its mother-rock

This particular kind, called "silver", is of some worth, but you will need
either a mighty fire within or some kind of helpful tool to remove it.

What will you do with this mass of potential Treasure?

\option Melt if from the rocks with your breath.

\event{dx7c}
You grasp the Shakestick in your maw, aim it at the shinestone and press the
indentations with a foreclaw.

The Air pulses with ripples like the disturbed surface of a pond, silent but
still rattling your teeth, and the stone grasping the silver treasure is broken
apart in shuddering fits right before your very muzzle, releasing chunks of its
precious bounty.

There is almost too much to transport back to your den... it takes you a few
trips... but your trove has grown immensely this day. For a hatchling, you now
have great wealth. You go to sleep atop the shiny mass and dream all night of
how vast your treasure-holdings shall grow.

%%%%%%%%%% use dragonfire %%%%%%%%%%%

\event{dx7as}
\effect{FirebreathEffect}
It takes several mighty blasts, but your fiery breath burns like a shed scale
of Sun himself.

The shiny treasure-rock loses its hard shape and you manage to harvest much of
it, though some remains.

\option /EndEvent \set{TREASURE_SHIN += 16}
\soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{DayTransition}


\event{dx7af}
\effect{FirebreathEffect}
Your breath is fierce enough to make Plants bow down before you and causes Grass
to catch flame, but this Shinestone, a hatchling of Earth Herself, is more solid
by far.

You will need to grow the Fire Within more greatly before you can melt this. You
are too exhausted to try again now, but at least this has been good practice.

\option /EndEvent \set{FIRE += 3}
\soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{DayTransition}


%%%%%%%%%%% use claw %%%%%%%%%%

\event{dx7bs}
It is a long and weary affair to break the jealous, miserly stone away from the
precious treasure using the hard parts of your Body, and you injure yourself
twice (one broken tooth and one split claw), but you do manage to get a few
chunks of the treasure out. A very few.

\option /EndEvent \set{TREASURE_SHIN += 5}
	\soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{DayTransition}


\event{dx7bf}
You have learned a valuable lesson this Sun: the power of Stone to resist your
Body is very, very great.

Despite your impassionated scrabblings and a bloody claw, the shinestone
remains maddeningly mated to the cliff face. One tiny chip is all you get for
your efforts this day.

\option /EndEvent \set{TREASURE_SHIN += 1} \set{FIRE += 1}
	\soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{DayTransition}

\sound{base:Audio/DX7_Ambience DX7Amb} \effect{OpenTray 1}
Returning to the shinestone-riddled mountain-wall, you see that there is a small
amount left. Spend the day melting it loose and transporting it back to the den?

\option Yes.
\if{ENERGY >= 6}
	\set{ENERGY -= 5} \set{TEMP_FORESHADOW_ENERGY -= 5} \go{dx7aa1}
\option No. \soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{HeartboneValley_Map}

\event{dx7aa1}
\effect{FirebreathEffect}
It is tiring, but as you pile more fire-refined shinestone into your trove, you
feel that the effort was well-spent.

\option /EndEvent \set{TREASURE_SHIN += 8} \set{DX7_STATE = 3}
	\soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{DayTransition}


\event{dx7bb}
\image{base:dx7_background}
\sound{base:Audio/DX7_Ambience DX7Amb} \effect{OpenTray 1}
You could use your teeth and claws to rip a bit more of the shinestone out of
this outcropping. It would take much effort, and probably a little pain. Will
you?

\option Yes.
\if{ENERGY >= 11}
	\set{ENERGY -= 10} \set{TEMP_FORESHADOW_ENERGY -= 10}
	\set{DAMAGE += 3} \go{dx7bb1}
\option Not this Sun.
	\soundStop{DX7Amb} \transition{fade} \go{HEARTBONEVALLEY_MAP}

\event{dx7bb1}
Earth yields up a little more of Her precious silvery flesh before the stones
around it collapse, trapping the rest. Still, your toil was not in vain, and
your trove has grown a little this Sun.

\option /EndEvent \set{TREASURE_SHIN += 5} \set{DX7_STATE = 3}
