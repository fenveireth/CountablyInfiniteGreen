Welcome to the CountablyInfiniteGreen wiki!

## What is this ?

This is an unofficial patch force-enabling the game's modding support (that is
hidden at release because unfinished)

Extra content is loaded from a Mods folder

It also finishes / augments some aspects of the modding support, to a small extent

## As a player:

Quickly get started :

- [How to install loader - start moddable version](./install-loader)
- [How to install mods](./install_mods)

## As an author

Create content by mimicking the annotated example mod. It should demonstrate the
usage of all of the features

- [Packaging your mod](./package)
- [Ingame console cheatsheet](./console)
- [Visual Effects](./graphics)

Essential resources :

- Player.log file : written in `%APPDATA%/LocalLow/Dreaming Door Studios` for
	every session. All errors go there, even when the error popup doesn't show in
	game
- The base game : the 'Main as a mod' is mostly legit, every single line in
	Mods/Main and Mods/timeofcreation does something observable
- [AssetsView](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET), ILSpy : to figure
	out the parts of the base game that are not moddable
